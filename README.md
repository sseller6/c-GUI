# Overview

As a software engineer, I felt it is important to learn C++. This repository documents the journey of my first GUI.

This program is the first of a 3 phase project. It's purpose is to prove that I've downloaded and installed the necessary libraries required to get C++ to work on my machine.

Below is a YouTube link to my demonstration video.
